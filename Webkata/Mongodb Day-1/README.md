MongoDB is a non-relational, open-source document database that's designed to store and manage large amounts of data. It's built for scalability, flexibility, and high availability, and it's compatible across platforms. MongoDB uses a flexible data model that stores data in JSON-like documents, which can vary from document to document. This allows for unstructured data storage, and it makes it easier and faster to retrieve data from the database because there's no need for joins between multiple tables.
